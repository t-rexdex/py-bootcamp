what are fixtures?
what does it mean to find the right level of fixtures?
'Fixtures are great for extracting data or objects that you use across multiple tests. However, they arenâ€™t always as good for tests that require slight variations in the data. Littering your test suite with fixtures is no better than littering it with plain data or objects. It might even be worse because of the added layer of indirection.'
monkeypatch is a plugin dealing with replacing values and behaviours
so a fixture is a function that get ran/plugged into functions at runtime?
